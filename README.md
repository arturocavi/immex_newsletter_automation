# IMMEX Newsletter Automation
Automation of IMMEX analysis newsletter for Jalisco data created with R and VBA.

## Overview
In order to automate the elaboration of a newsletter that is published monthly to save time and avoid typos, a solution was developed so that the entire newsletter could be produced without having to write or make graphics, requiring no more than running a code in R, adding a macro to the generated Excel file and running it. This generates a Word document with the wording of the analysis and the graphs generated according to the latest information published by INEGI for the Manufacturing, Assembly and Export Services Industry Program (IMMEX).\
The newsletter was written in Spanish for the Institute of Statistical and Geographic Information of Jalisco (IIEG).
